```

 Simply load the cna file and type "privcheck"<br>
 If you want to compile by yourself you can use:<br>
```make all```<br>
or <br>
```x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc -c cfile.c -o ofile.o```

If you want to look for just one misconf you can use object file with "inline-execute" for example<br>
``` inline-execute /path/tokenprivileges.o```
